Coding Bootcamp HW6 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**GifWall** is a video wall page designed by Kyle Rosenmeyer. It is a demonstration of using the GIPHY API with a clean and modern look.

This game is useful to learn the principals of using AJAX requests and accessing api content for a rich web experience. It also demonstrates the use of sessionStorage to improve user experience.

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however
Kyle Rosenmeyer may be contacted through his website for help or questions
regarding the project.
